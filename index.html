                Hi everyone! <br>

                We are so glad you could join us here and take the time to get to know us better! <br> <br>

                EVCC was established in 1990 and have been going strong ever since. We are a non-profit organization,
                that was first planted by Evangelical Formosan Church of East Valley as a community outreach ministry.
                <br> <br>

                We are a chorale group with ages that begin from 7 years old to 18 years old. Stop by on Sundays and see
                what we do!
